# 🚢 Battleship Game — C++

## 📌 Overview
The Battleship Game is a console-based implementation of the classic Battleship game developed in C++ using object-oriented programming principles.  
The project supports both multiplayer (2v2) and single-player (1vBot) modes and demonstrates the practical application of data structures and game logic.

---

## 🎮 Game Modes
- 2v2 Multiplayer Mode – Two players compete against each other on separate grids
- 1vBot Mode – A player competes against an AI-controlled opponent

---

## 🧠 Concepts & Data Structures Used
- Object-Oriented Programming
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance and Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
- Data Structures
  - 2D Arrays – Game boards
  - Vectors – Ship storage and attack history
  - Sets / Maps – Track hits, misses, and visited positions

---

## ⚙️ Game Features
- Ship placement with validation
- Hit and miss detection
- Turn-based gameplay
- AI opponent with randomized attack logic
- Win condition detection
- Console-based board visualization
